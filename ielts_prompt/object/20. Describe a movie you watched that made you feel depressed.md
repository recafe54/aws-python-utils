Sample Answer:

The movie that made me feel depressed was "Fast & Furious 9," which I watched last year. I watched it alone as I am a fan of the franchise and was excited to see the latest installment. However, my expectations were not met, and I felt disappointed after watching it.

One of the main reasons why I didn't like the movie was that its logic didn't make sense. The storyline seemed implausible and far-fetched, even for a series known for its over-the-top action sequences. The film seemed to prioritize spectacle and exaggerated stunts over a coherent plot and believable character development. As a result, I found it challenging to connect with the story and the characters, which left me feeling detached and unsatisfied.

Additionally, I felt that the movie relied heavily on excessive use of computer-generated imagery (CGI). While the previous films in the franchise have always had thrilling action scenes, "Fast & Furious 9" took it to a new level, and not in a positive way. The CGI felt excessive and unrealistic, which further disconnected me from the movie. Instead of being immersed in the story, I found myself constantly reminded of the artificiality of the visuals, which contributed to my disappointment.

Furthermore, the movie seemed to prioritize spectacle over substance. It lacked the emotional depth and character development that I had come to appreciate in the earlier films. The focus on extravagant action sequences overshadowed the human element, making it difficult for me to become emotionally invested in the story.

Overall, "Fast & Furious 9" left me feeling disappointed and depressed because it didn't live up to my expectations. The lack of a coherent plot, excessive use of CGI, and a focus on spectacle rather than substance all contributed to my feelings of dissatisfaction. As a fan of the franchise, it was disheartening to see a film that didn't capture the essence of what I enjoyed about the previous movies.
